Programming Is Not Hard If You Know How To Learn

Programming Is Not Hard If You Know How To Learn

So here is what you need to perform deliberate practice on your own:

1 Teacher: provides practice activities designed to help you improve performance.
2 Perform at maximum effort: constantly being taken out of your comfort zone.
3 Well defined and specific goals: not just “overall improvement.”
4 To be in focus: give your full attention, no distractions.
5 Do conscious actions: no autopilot.
6 Instant response to feedback and modifying your strategy.
When you start learning a new language, technology, framework, whatever, stick to these rules to get big results as quickly as possible.
